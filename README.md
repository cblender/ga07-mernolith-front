# M E R N O L I T H

The Mernolith is a curated collection of film directors with some of their most important works. You can add directors and films, edit them, and delete them.

Deployed site: https://cblender.github.io/ga08-mernolith-front/
# Homepage

The homepage serves up all directors in the database in a grid layout. Clicking on a director directs the user to the page for that director.

# Director Pages

Each director page displays information about the director, including a portrait formatted as a background image. Additionally, the director page serves up all movies that were directed by that director, and displays them in a grid.

# Movies

Clicking on a movie opens a modal object that displays detailed information about the movie. Individual movies have detailed information associated with them in the database, and this is displayed when a movie is clicked on.

# Adding

MERNOLITH provides the user with an interface for adding content to the database. Currently, this functionality is only available for movies, with plans to implement adding directors in the future. In the director page and the "all movies" page, clicking the "add" button will display a modal form that the user can fill out, including fields for image links. Submitting the form will add a new movie to the database with the specified properties. Adding a movie under a Director page will automatically add that movie to that director's repertoire.

# Modifying

MERNOLITH provides the user with the ability to modify information for existing movies and directors. Currently, this functionality is incomplete and is not available in production yet.

# Deleting

MERNOLITH provides the user with the ability to delete entries from the movie and director databases. Currently, this functionality is only available for movies, with plans to improve data control across the board in the future, which is required before deletion of directors can be implemented.
